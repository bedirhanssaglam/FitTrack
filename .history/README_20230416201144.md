## Folders

First of all, there are two main builds in our src>lib folder. These are view and core structures.

- core: This layer is the part that will manage or initiate the work that will do our main work.

base: This layer contains our main functions and singleton files.

components: This layer contains widgets that we can use on the pages, such as button, appbar, which we can create here and customize with parameters where we want to use them.

constants: This layer consists of two structures, these structures are app and enums structures.

extensions: This layer and the project contain the basic structure, String and int.

init: This layer consists of 3 main structures. These structures are cache , dependency_injection and routes.

- view: This layer contains our screens. We can create a folder for each screen. There is a folder for each page in the view.
